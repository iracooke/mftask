/*!
 @abstract Encapsulates an NSTask providing easy capture of output via its delegate
 @discussion Provides an API for NSTask objects that is more similar to NSURLConnection. All output from the task can easily be captured via the delegate methods defined in MFTaskDelegateProtocol. MFTask objects accept a tag so that a delegate can recognise output from multiple tasks. Although a standard input pipe can be set, the standard output and standard input are managed internally.
